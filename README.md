## Organization

it's based on the NATIONAL pokÃ©dex THE LAST VERSION

it loads all photos IN ONCE but if it's lags too much, it will be updated step by step

from a pokÃ©mon, we show only official artworks from pokÃ©mon (because they're cutty)

- [x] create all the function requests
    - [x] get all names C
    - [x] get all icons C
    - [x] get all numbers (National) Q => passed in pokÃ©mon description
    - [x] from a pokemon
        - [x] get his type Q
